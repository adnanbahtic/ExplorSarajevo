                    Sarajevo City Hall (Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: Gradska vijećnica Sarajevo / Градска вијећница
                    Сарајево), known as Vijećnica, is located in the city of Sarajevo. It was designed in 1891 by the
                    Czech architect Karel Pařík, but criticisms by the minister, Baron Benjamin Kallay, caused him to
                    stop working on the project. It was initially the largest and most representative building of the
                    Austro-Hungarian period in Sarajevo and served as the city hall. The building was reopened on
                    May 9, 2014.
                    On 25 August 1992, Serbian shelling during the Siege of Sarajevo caused the complete destruction of
                    the library; among the losses were about 700 manuscripts and incunabula and a unique collection of
                    Bosnian serial publications, some from the middle of the 19th century Bosnian cultural revival.
                    Before the attack, the library held 1.5 million volumes and over 155,000 rare books and
                    manuscripts. Some citizens and librarians tried to save some books while they were under sniper
                    fire, at least one person died.

                    The majority of the books could not be saved from the flames. The structural repair of the building
                    was planned to be carried out in four stages: 1996-1997 (financed by a donation from Republic of
                    Austria), and 2000-2004 (financed by a donation from the European Commission), and the city of
                    Barcelona among others. The third stage ended in September 2012, with an estimated cost of KM 4.6
                    million (about €2.37 million) and will return the city hall to its former grace. The fourth stage
                    began following the completion of the third stage and lasted about 20 months, finishing at the end
                    of 2013 and cost of KM 14 million (about €7.23 million) which are secured through the IPA. In this
                    stage the whole interior was built and reconstructed (paintings, sculptures, books), meaning the
                    building is brought back to function. Everything that was possible to restore has been done so,
                    while those things that were not possible to save have been made anew through special molds. The
                    whole reconstruction and restore process was predicted to cost about KM 25 million (about €13
                    million).

                    After it is repaired, the building, now a national monument, will be used for variety of events. Its
                    space will be used for various protocol events for all levels of government, concerts and
                    exhibitions.
